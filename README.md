I made this project to show how LLMs work. In this project, the user can use the Gemini LLM through the interface. It allows you to change the model parameters to bring change in response
as required, the function for fine tuning and model training comming soon. The interface also allows you to see debugging trace calls.
Note: Install required Libraries, and use appropriate API key.
